The Excel file I uploaded to my personal repository contains three sheets named General Data, Pivot Table, and Dashboard.

In the first sheet, General Data, I created a base table that provides information on product categories, sales and profit amounts, geographical regions, sales dates, product types, and product IDs or serial numbers. Based on this base table, I then created a Pivot Table to visualize the data, including commonly used slicers and pivot charts. Since profit margin is one of the critical KPIs in most organizations, I also added this column to the Pivot Table.

Finally, I created a sheet called Dashboard to summarize and present the data, making the data analysis process more integrated and streamlined.
